            Here I will be talking about how it all started, from the first day I kicked the soccer till now, it all has been great and still great.
            I currently play for a semi pro team called 
           <a href="https://www.instagram.com/worcesterwarriors/?hl=en"><strong>Worcester warriors</strong></a>. I have been playing with this team for a good while now, currently one of the best players in the squad and hope to be better. 
            More information to be shared soon...
